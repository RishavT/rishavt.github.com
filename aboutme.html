I am a complete nerd when it comes to technology. I love to code, hack my computer/smartphone/iPod, tweak around with anything and everything that I find. I've been coding since 10 grade when I first learned how to code as a part of my curriculum, and it has become a hobby since then.

I also love analysis of problems and thinking 'out of the box'; solving problems which seem impossible to solve at first. Applying innovative approaches to problems when straightforward approaches fail is one of my strong points.

From a nontechnical point of view, I love music and play the guitar for my college as well as my local band "RainbowDreamers".
