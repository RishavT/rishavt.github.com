                            It also serves as a backup in case you accidentally delete those chats from GTalk.

                        <p>Nautilus Facebook Uploader (nfuploader) was a desktop application allowing for easy upload of pictures to facebook.
                            It allowed for simple right-click uploads, batch photo uploads, creating new albums, etc. I had made this back when
                            facebook photo uploading was not up to the mark for linux, and it's not really needed anymore since coming of easy-to-use
                            web based uploaders.

                        <p>SMSS was a desktop application to send free text messages (SMS) via online gateways such as <a href="http://way2sms.com">Way2SMS</a>.
                            It allowed for bulk messages involving multiple recipients, as well as a google contact sync.
                            I have stopped maintaining this project as websites such as Way2SMS discourage such things and constantly keep changing their APIs 
                            every few months.
