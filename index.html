                    <p>Nautilus Facebook Uploader (nfuploader) was a desktop application allowing for easy upload of pictures to facebook.
                        It allowed for simple right-click uploads, batch photo uploads, creating new albums, etc. I had made this back when
                        facebook photo uploading was not up to the mark for linux, and it's not really needed anymore since coming of easy-to-use
                        web based uploaders.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is completely open source! Take a look at it over <a href="projects/nfuploader.html">here.</a></p>

                <div id="proj-smss">
                    <h3>SMSS (obsolete)</h3>
                    <p>SMSS was a desktop application to send free text messages (SMS) via online gateways such as <a href="http://way2sms.com">Way2SMS</a>.
                        It allowed for bulk messages involving multiple recipients, as well as a google contact sync.
                        I have stopped maintaining this project as websites such as Way2SMS discourage such things and constantly keep changing their APIs 
                        every few months.
