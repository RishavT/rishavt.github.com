        <h1>Whitewater River Rafting Adventures in Ladakh</h1>
	<h2>Wet n Wild Explorations</h2>
	<p>
	Welcome to Wet & Wild Explorations, the premier destination for rafting and kayaking adventures in the breathtaking landscapes of Ladakh. Founded by Tsering Chotak, one of India's most renowned kayakers, our company embodies the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of excellence. Tsering, a self-made legend in the world of kayaking, has not only represented India at the Freestyle Kayaking Championships in Germany but also conquered the formidable class IV/V rapids of the Lohit River in Arunachal Pradesh, marking a first for any Indian paddler. His journey from a humble porter for the Indian Army to the owner of one of the most famous whitewater companies in India is a testament to his dedication and passion for the river. With numerous first descents in Bhutan and India under his belt, Tsering spends over half the year on the river, where he feels most at home, akin to a joyful child. A mentor to world-class kayakers, he plans to pass on his legacy to his young son, preparing to introduce him to the world of kayaking. Join us at Wet & Wild Explorations for an unforgettable experience on the water, guided by the expertise of Tsering Chotak and his team, where every paddle stroke is a story of adventure, resilience, and the pure joy of being one with the river. <a href="https://www.wetnwildexplorations.com">Find out more about our team here!</a>
